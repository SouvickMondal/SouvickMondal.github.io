Voting App | Count number of Votes | User Verification


The frontend is written in Angular2+, using advanced concepts like Interceptors, Guards, and many more.
The application contains 4 module, bootstrapper being APP module, and other modules includes the following:
1) Auth Module: Responsible for authorization
2) CommentApp Module: The main comments app
3) CoreF Module: Data Service module

Auth Module has two components named:
1) SignUp component
2) Login component

It consists of interceptor, which intercepts every request to add header and handle 401 error at one place.
It consists of guard which protects routes and activates it only when wanted.
(Person cannot open login/signup page once he/she is loggedIN, and vice-e-versa, he/she can't open any main page, if not authenticated)


CommentAppModule contains the main application module, which contains business logic in comments component

CoreF module includes services which are responsible for authorization,data fetch calls to backend server.


Application allows you to login if you have account or create the account if required. It would use localstorage to store a token (which for simplicity is user_id generated by mongo for now), which is used as furthur authentication for the calls it make once user is logged in.
